<H1>TASK 1</H1>
A collection of files for " Málaga Average Temperatures in D3.js"
D3js is a small JavaScript library to modify the DOM based on data (D3 = Data Driven Documents).

In this project we can see a temperature diagram of málaga. The months of the year are represented on the X axis and the temperatures on the Y axis. Each bar represented one month of the year. On the right there is a legend that explains the colors of the bars, as for example the temperatures greater than 27º are in red. In addition, there is a grid line that represents horizontal lines.
