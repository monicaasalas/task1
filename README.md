<H1>Málaga Average Temperatures: D3.js"</H1>

In this project we can see a temperature diagram of málaga. The months of the year are represented on the X axis and the temperatures on the Y axis. Each bar represented one month of the year. On the right there is a legend that explains the colors of the bars, as for example the temperatures greater than 27º are in red. In addition, there is a grid line that represents horizontal lines.

<H2>What is D3js</H2>

D3.js (Data Driven Documents) is not a programming language. It is a JavaScript based library used for creating dynamic data displays. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.

<H2>Installation</H2>

You need to download the entire repository, which gives you not only the JavaScript files but also all the source code of the components. Once you have the downloaded repository, we will verify that we have installed node. Next, we install the dependencies in the local folder node_modules with the command <b> npm-install </ b>.
To run the script defined in the package.json, we must do <b> npm install </ b>.
